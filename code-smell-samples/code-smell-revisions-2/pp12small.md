### Summary of the Original Content CodeSmell.
The original content discusses a common problem in software testing where changes in one part of the system often break many tests due to interdependencies between layers of an application's architecture. This problem is exacerbated when actual instances of dependencies are used in tests, causing ripples of failures when a low-level change is made. The content offers two main causes for this issue: a layered application architecture and the Detroit-school TDD approach, which can lead to 'God objects' with excessive code reuse. Two methods are suggested for dealing with this problem: replacing deep layer dependencies with test doubles and reevaluating the value of middle-tier tests that fail frequently without catching bugs.

## Odor Emitted: Integration Chains
Often in enterprise systems, a change in a single entity can cause a cascade of test failures across various modules, which were not directly modified. This excessive coupling between components can cause early fatigue in managing tests and diminish the overall maintainability of the codebase.

## Known Causes

### 1. Deep-Rooted Business Logic

Many enterprise systems rely on deeply nested business logic where higher-level operations depend on a series of underlying modules. As each module is added or changed, a set of accompanying tests are also written. This results in a testing pyramid where any significant modification to the core logic could impact the entire structure, causing a series of test failures which may not even relate directly to the change at hand.

#### Deodorizer

Combatting this issue requires discipline and a strategic approach:
1. Utilize stubs or mocks to isolate the business logic at various levels, ensuring higher-level tests are not unduly affected by changes in the underlying modules.
2. When a large number of tests fail due to a single change, inventory and evaluate those tests. Are they all necessary, or are some merely duplicating the assertions of others?

### 2. Dependencies with Broad Scope

When dependencies within the system perform a wide range of functions and are reused across different components, they can become a liability. As the system grows, these multifunction dependencies are covered by an increasing number of tests, making them brittle to changes.

#### Deodorizer

To alleviate this growing pressure:
1. Break down broad-scoped dependencies into smaller, more cohesive units. This reduces the number of tests impacted by a single change.
2. Review and potentially decommission test cases that serve little purpose other than confirming that unchanged components still function as expected after a change elsewhere in the system.

## About this Example

### Description

Reflecting on the code provided, we see an encapsulation of complex financial logic divided across several granular methods responsible for computing profits at varying time scales. This structure is emblematic of the layered logic architectures discussed earlier.

### Challenge

Imagine our client has just revealed that a core assumption of our profit calculation is flawed: rather than rounding profits, they need the precision of exact values. Such a pivot requires us to amend our calculation method and face the repercussions across our suite of tests.

Given the context, it is time to scrutinize our approach. Assess whether the current tests serve their intended purpose or if we could benefit from some strategic pruning. Might the use of test doubles be warranted here to mitigate the ripple effect of our impending changes? This alteration and subsequent test suite examination could be a valuable exercise for any development team.
