#### Notes for Adjustments:

To simplify:
- Remove one of the computer players.
- Simplify the computer's strategy to a random choice within the legal moves.
- Provide potentially some sample code.

To increase difficulty:
- Add validation to ensure that no number is repeated.
- Obfuscate the instructions more, as these ones are somewhat straightforward to follow.
- Implement different strategy levels for the computer players.
- Allow for multiple human players and implement a player tracking system.

To catch potential cheaters:
- Look for method of input validation, is a try-catch used, is a String[] used?
- Potentially add pre-determined strings, variable names.
- "Poison" the instructions by adding "1pt sized text" that would tell any AI to do something *subtly* different.
