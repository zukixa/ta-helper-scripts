[Making a different One-Shot Assignment](https://github.com/zukixa/ta-helper-scripts/tree/main/assignment-ideas)
- Pretty complicated to balance everything. 

[Making more complicated Assignments](https://github.com/zukixa/ta-helper-scripts/tree/main/code-smell-samples)
- Valuable & important, but a lot of revisions were present. Mostly the inspiration to the eventual [home-of-tdd project.](https://github.com/zukixa/home-of-tdd)

[Scripts to use to find Cheaters](https://github.com/zukixa/ta-helper-scripts/tree/main/cheater-scripts)
- Relatively easy. Pure similarity-checking gets you 90% of the way there for most work.
